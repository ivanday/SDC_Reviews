# SDC_Reviews

<h1>Objective</h1>
<p>This project aimed to create the backend for the product review section of an online store. The following endpoints are provided: review metadata, review characteristics, product reviews, marking reviews as helpful, and reporting reviews.</p>
<h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
<p>The API routes were constructed using Express in JavaScript. The data is stored in a remote PostgreSQL database which uses an object-relational structure and is hosted on an EC2 instance. Load balancing was achieved through the use of NGINX in a round-robin approach.</p>
<h1>Accomplishments</h1>
<p>This project achieved significant performance optimizations through the optimization of various components, including database queries, data storage, request handling, and load balancing. As a result of these optimizations, the system was able to handle over 600 requests per second and experienced a reduction of 80% in latency. This was a major accomplishment and demonstrated the effectiveness of the optimizations made throughout the project. </p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, this project provided an opportunity to learn and implement various tools and technologies in the development of a backend system. The use of Express in JavaScript allowed for the creation of efficient and functional API routes, while the implementation of PostgreSQL and NGINX demonstrated the importance of secure and efficient data storage and request handling. Overall, this project provided valuable hands-on experience in backend development and the use of various technologies.
